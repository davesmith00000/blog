# Open Source Projects

I maintain two projects, which is one more project than I really have time to look after.

Indigo and Tyrian are both based on variations of the TEA Pattern, and both named after shades of purple.

## üïπÔ∏è Indigo

**A game engine for functional programmers written in Scala 3.**

_Maintenance pattern:_ Functional games programming is my main passion, and so Indigo is the project I mostly work on.

## ‚òï Tyrian

**An Elm-like frontend framework for Scala 3.**

_Maintenance pattern:_ Tyrian is based on a fork of an earlier library called Scalm. I don't have a lot of need to do SPA / Interactive web dev, but when I do, this is the only way I want to work, and so Tyrian tends to get an upgrade.
