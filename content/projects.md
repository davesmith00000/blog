### üïπÔ∏è Indigo

**A game engine for functional programmers written in Scala 3.**

My primary interest is in Indigo, which is a Scala.js game engine based on a version of 'The Elm Architecture' (aka the TEA pattern). I wanted to make games, in Scala, using functional programming, using an architecture that makes testing easy and fun. Indigo is my attempt to bring that dream to life.

### ‚òï Tyrian

**An Elm-like web framework for Scala 3.**

Tyrian is a fork of Scalm, an Elm-inspired web framework for Scala.js. I adopted Tyrian because if you're making web games, you sometimes need to do web things, and the Elm arch is the only way I want to do that.

### üåà Ultraviolet

**A Scala 3 to GLSL transpiler library.**

The latest addition to the family is Ultraviolet. Writing games on modern hardware means writing Shaders. Shaders are fun! GLSL (the shader language supported by WebGL) is a very accessible way to write shaders, but I've found the tooling rather basic. Ultraviolet allows you to write a subset of Scala and transpile it to GLSL using inline macros. It was primarily made to support Indigo, but you can use it for any GLSL use case, such as [ShaderToy](https://shadertoy.com/).

## Earlier work

### üìù Scala-Pact

**A pure Scala implementation of Pact Consumer Driven Contract testing**

I was the orginal author of Scala-Pact, and it was a good project in it's day. My interest in it waned as my career moved in a different direction. Other brave souls carried on it's maintenance for a long while, but it has now fallen behind the Pact standard.
